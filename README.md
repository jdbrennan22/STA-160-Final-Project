# STA-160-Final-Project ## Superconductivity UCI-data analysis
The goal of this report is to explore a multivariate data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Superconductivity. Points of interest include but are not limited to, comparing multiple labels with respect to one single feature, measuring associative relations between a numerical response variable and multiple covariate features, and working with linear regression to best fit the data. The code can be found in the ` ` folder, and the report write-up can be found in the ` ` folder.
