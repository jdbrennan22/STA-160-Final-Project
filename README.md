## Superconductivity UCI-dataset Analysis

The goal of this report is to explore a multivariate data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Superconductivity. Points of interest include but are not limited to, comparing multiple labels with respect to one single feature, measuring associative relations between a numerical response variable and multiple covariate features, and working with linear regression to best fit the data. The full report can be found in the `STA 160 - Final Project.pdf` file. **Rmarkdown** Files - The rmd file, `STA 160 Final.Rmd`, contains the source code for the analysis of the data set.
